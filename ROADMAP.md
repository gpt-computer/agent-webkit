# Roadmap

Every idea and every report about GPT Computer, in one place: what is being built
right now, what goes out with the next version, what comes after, and what
is not on the list — each with where it came from. GitHub issues, pull
requests, the emails that reach hello@khulnasoft.com and the replies on X
all land here.

**The live version is [khulnasoft.com/search/roadmap](https://khulnasoft.com/search/roadmap)**:
it changes the moment the work does. This file is a copy of the same list,
written by `./ideas md`. What has shipped is in [NOTES.md](NOTES.md).

Want something that isn't here? [Open an issue](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues).
Want to build something that is? Say so on its issue first, so two people
don't build it twice.

## Keeping it whole

The list is only worth something if nothing is missing from it and nothing
in it is stale. Whoever works on GPT Computer keeps it that way, with `./ideas`
(`./ideas help` for everything it does):

- **Every new idea or report gets its line the day it arrives**, whatever the
  source: an issue, a pull request, an email, a reply on X, a message.
  `./ideas find` first: if it is already there, `./ideas from ID SOURCE` adds
  the new voice instead of a second line.
- **Say what you're building as you start**: `./ideas start ID "who"`, and
  `./ideas done ID` when it's on main, in the same breath as its line in
  NOTES.md. The page shows both at once.
- **`./ideas check`** compares the list with GitHub: every open issue and pull
  request without its idea, and every idea still to do whose issue or pull
  request is closed. Run it whenever you pick up where someone else left off.
- **`./ideas md`** writes this file again; commit it with the work.
- **Public.** Emails are marked *(email)*, never with a name or an address. A
  security report sent privately never comes here, not even in outline: it
  is fixed, it ships, and only then is it credited in NOTES.md.

## Done, in the next version

- [x] **iCloud Passwords** Pairs on the first code and stays paired: its first messages now wait for Apple's helper, and an extension talking to an app on the Mac stays awake, as in Chrome. Tested with a stand-in helper; to confirm with Apple's own in the next build. *([#17](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/17), email ×2, [#217](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/217))*
- [x] **Settings sidebar corners** The Settings sidebar has rounded inner corners. A fix is waiting in [#222](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/222). *([#221](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/221), [#222](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/222), [#226](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/226))*
- [x] **⇧⌘C copies without a word** ⇧⌘C copies the address, but nothing in the app says so. A fix is waiting in [#182](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/182). *([#176](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/176), [#182](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/182))*
- [x] **Links from other apps skip the pins** A link opened from another app never lands among the pins. *([#219](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/219))*
- [x] **Little window for outside links** A little window for links opened from other apps, and a shortcut to open it from anywhere. *(X, [#227](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/227))*
- [x] **Pop-ups named by their site** A window a page opens at a size of its own is named in the tabs by its site, not by the title the page chose. *(message)*

## Now — fixes for the next update

- [ ] **Bitwarden goes blank after sign-in** For one person it doesn't load at all. Before signing in it works — popup, WebAssembly, background. Probably fixed by 1Password's worker fix ([#126](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/126)) and the extension storage fix in 1.0.2; needs a real account to confirm. Also asked: a self-hosted Vaultwarden server behind the extension. *(X, email)*
- [ ] **Bitwarden on Intel Macs** The extension says "WebAssembly is not supported" on an Intel Mac. *([#175](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/175))*
- [ ] **Google sign-in flashes with Proton Pass** With Proton Pass signed in, Google's sign-in page reloads every half second. Presumed fixed in 1.0.2 by [#126](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/126) and the passkey changes; to confirm with the person who saw it. *(X)*
- [ ] **Vimium C doesn't start** Its background now starts ([#170](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/170), on main); it doesn't answer its keys yet. *(X, email, [#170](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/170))*
- [ ] **Passkeys under the sign-in field** A site's passkey button brings up the Mac's passkey sheet now; next is the suggestion Safari shows as you click into a sign-in field. *([#17](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/17), X)*
- [ ] **Window stutters between screens** Dragging the window from one screen to another stutters. Needs a trace recorded on two screens. *(X)*
- [ ] **⌘F lands on the back button** On some pages ⌘F focuses the back button instead of the find field. *([#172](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/172))*
- [ ] **Wrong icons on some tabs** Meta AI shows Google's G, Swagger UI stays on a letter. [#216](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/216) fixes it; two small changes asked before it goes in. *([#181](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/181), [#216](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/216))*
- [ ] **Window flashes at its default size** At launch the window opens at its default size for an instant, then takes its saved size. [#204](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/204) tried a fix; in a test it lost the saved size instead, so changes were asked. *([#202](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/202), [#204](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/204))*
- [ ] **Early content scripts miss restored pages** A content script that runs at document_start can miss the page restored at a hidden launch. *([#199](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/199))*
- [ ] **Suggestions slow with a big history** Address suggestions slow down with a large history. *([#200](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/200))*
- [ ] **Stuttering pages** Details to gather. *([#211](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/211))*
- [ ] **Floating video on Twitch, Netflix, X** Netflix: the picture now stays inside the floating window and subtitles show ([#190](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/190), on main). Still open: part of the picture on Twitch, sometimes no picture on YouTube, only some of the time on X. *([#123](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/123), email ×2, [#190](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/190))*
- [ ] **Videos stuck muted** Some video sites play muted, with nothing to turn the sound on. *([#223](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/223))*
- [ ] **Ad blocker leaves empty spaces** On news sites like AS.com, blocked ads leave gaps in the page. *([#159](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/159))*
- [ ] **Chatbot pages struggle or crash** grok.com and other chatbot pages; details asked. *(email)*
- [ ] **x.com reloads before sign-in** x.com reloads over and over before signing in. Not reproduced; asked whether extensions are installed. *(email)*
- [ ] **Figma and LinkedIn feel slow** Figma blurs for a moment as you zoom in; LinkedIn's feed and profiles scroll with lag. *(email)*
- [ ] **Spaces sometimes don't switch** *(email)*
- [ ] **Hidden sidebar closes too soon** It closes while the pointer is over the extension buttons at its foot. Maybe fixed by [#115](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/115) in 1.0.2; unconfirmed. *(email)*
- [ ] **Middle-click on YouTube links** A middle-click on YouTube links works only some of the time. 1.0.2 added middle-click on links; to confirm there. *(email)*
- [ ] **Extension popups miss messages** Extension popups and extension pages don't receive messages from the extension's background in a test run (the offscreen document does). To check in a window on screen; would matter for popups waiting on the background.
- [ ] **Dragging a pin redraws the column** Dragging a pin redraws the whole column each frame, as dragging a tab did before 1.0.2.
- [ ] **Bookmarks popover closes on fold** The bookmarks popover closes when the hidden sidebar folds (it counts as leaving the sidebar). A fix is waiting in [#89](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/89). *([#88](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/88), [#89](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/89))*
- [ ] **⌥⌫ with an inline completion** With the rest of an address offered inline, Option-Backspace does nothing; it should drop the offer and delete the last word typed. *([#228](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/228))*

- [ ] **Your own keyboard shortcuts** In Settings › Shortcuts. Waiting on its author to rebase and simplify. Editing extension shortcuts belongs with it ([#189](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/189)). *([#36](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/36), [#189](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/189), X)*

- [ ] **Site search keywords** Type a site's keyword, then your search. *([#188](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/188))*
- [ ] **Address bar commands** A word like "settings" reaches the app itself. *([#212](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/212))*
- [ ] **Hold a swipe to pick from history** Hold a back or forward swipe to pick a page from history. *([#191](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/191))*
- [ ] **Tabs load when shown** Tabs opened together don't all load at once: they wait until they're shown. *([#195](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/195), [#196](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/196))*
- [ ] **Don't reopen tabs at launch** A switch to start with a fresh window instead of last time's tabs. *(email)*
- [ ] **Pins as a list** Pins as a list, in rows instead of small squares. Also: site icons on pins without them in the tab list (one setting does both today), and Arc-style pinned rows above New Tab. *([#183](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/183), email ×2)*
- [ ] **Pins shared by every space** Pins shared by every space, plus each space's own, as in Arc. *(email)*
- [ ] **Box Tools** Let app.box.com reach its local helper on this Mac, as Chrome does. The person who asked offered to test a build. *(email)*
- [ ] **1Password desktop app, in the FAQ** 1Password with its desktop app. Say in the FAQ that GPT Computer is added in 1Password › Settings › Browser › Add Browser.
- [ ] **Intel Macs** One build for both kinds of Mac, only as a change to build.sh, as [#100](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/100) began. *([#46](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/46), X)*

## Later — bigger pieces of work

- [ ] **More extension APIs** More of the extension APIs. The side panel, and invisible offscreen documents ([#192](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/192)). *([#12](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/12), X, [#192](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/192))*
- [ ] **Drive GPT Computer from an agent** An MCP server over the bench, for automation and testing. An earlier pull request, [#14](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/14), began one. *(X)*
- [ ] **Web push notifications** As far as WebKit lets an app other than Safari have them. *(X)*
- [ ] **Split view** Two tabs or more side by side in one window. *([#173](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/173))*
- [ ] **Faster animations** Spaces especially, compared with Zen. *(email)*
- [ ] **Block YouTube's ads** YouTube's ads. They come from youtube.com itself, which the blocker's lists can't tell apart. Whether to go that far is an open question. *([#218](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/218), email)*
- [ ] **Extensions per space** Each space with the extensions it wants, on and off apart from the others. WebKit has one extension controller for the whole app, so this means one per space. Drice's call, 24 Sep: later. *(X)*

## Pull requests to review

- [ ] **GPT Computer doesn't come to the front** When another app, like Mail, opens a link in GPT Computer, its window stays behind. *([#95](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/95))*
- [ ] **Smoother mouse-wheel scrolling** Smoother scrolling with a mouse wheel. To look into. *(X)*

## Drice's call

- [ ] **Web processes start before the window** The web process pool is made before the first window; check whether 1.0.2's launch order already covers it. *([#157](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/157))*
- [ ] **Double-click for a new tab** A double-click below the tabs opens a new one. *([#162](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/162), [#167](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/167))*
- [ ] **Tab bar in the page's colour** The tab bar or title bar in the page's own colour. *([#158](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/158), [#168](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/168), [#25](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/25))*

- [ ] **Detach a tab into a window** Detach a tab into its own window. GPT Computer has one window, like [#72](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/72). *([#184](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/184), [#72](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/72), [#230](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/230))*

- [ ] **Sidebar on the right** The sidebar on the right. *(email)*
- [ ] **Toolbar buttons on the left** Back, forward and reload on the left with the tabs across the top. *(email)*
- [ ] **Autocomplete in a new tab** What exactly was asked, to find out. *(X)*
- [ ] **⌃Tab in recent-use order** ⌃Tab goes to the tab used last in this space, not the neighbour in the row; holding it walks back through them. Also asks for its own shortcut recorders in Settings › Tabs. *([#225](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/225))*
- [ ] **Dock the floating video at the side** Swipe the floating video into the side of the screen and it tucks away, leaving a sliver to bring it back by, as in Dia. *([#229](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/229))*

## Asked to try again on the latest version

- [ ] **Google asks for a reCAPTCHA** Google search asks for a reCAPTCHA. 1.0.2 no longer tells pages it is a separate app and says it is Safari. *([#26](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/26))*
- [ ] **NordPass doesn't work** *([#98](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/98))*

- [ ] **Page shortcuts vs GPT Computer's** Keep a page's editing shortcuts while GPT Computer's own still work. 1.0.2 gives the page the first go at its shortcuts; asked whether it's enough. *([#147](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/147))*

## Not on the list, for now

- **Address bar above the page** The card behind a tab's icon — the site, whether its connection is secure, copy, print, zoom — does that part without a bar. *([#15](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/15), [#56](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/56))*
- **Tab groups and folders** Spaces keep sets of tabs apart, and the column stays quiet. *([#23](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/23), [#68](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/68), [#31](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/31), [#54](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/54), [#76](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/76))*
- **Bookmarks in the column** The bookmarks bar, off unless turned on, and the Bookmarks menu are where they live. *([#58](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/58), [#69](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/69))*
- **Customization page** Settings stays short. *([#101](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/101), [#105](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/105), [#106](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/106), [#107](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/107), [#108](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/108), [#143](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/143), [#231](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/231))*
- **Hidden sidebar delay setting** The default is what changes instead. *([#118](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/118))*
- **Floating launcher** ⌘S and a folded column already give the page the whole window. *([#18](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/18))*
- **Proxy extensions** WebKit doesn't give it to extensions. *([#12](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/12))*
- **Drag a tab into a new window** GPT Computer has one window. *([#72](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/72))*
- **Snoozing tabs** For now. *([#111](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/111))*
- **Vim mode** Vimium works. *([#160](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/160))*
- **Brazilian Portuguese** For now. *([#113](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/113))*
- **Windows and Linux** GPT Computer is made of the Mac's own WebKit and AppKit; there is nothing to carry over. *([#62](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/62), [#64](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/64), [#65](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/65), [#197](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/pull/197))*
- **macOS before 14** The app leans on what macOS 14 added to WebKit.
- **Accounts and sync** Bookmarks with Google, tabs across devices. GPT Computer has no server and keeps everything on your Mac; importing is the way in. *([#224](https://github.com/KhulnaSoft/GPT%20Computer/issues/224))*
